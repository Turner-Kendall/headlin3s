# Headlin3s
#### v3.0.0
### This Repo holds the front end and back end for the Headlin3s project

### Tech Stack
- **Vite:** v2.x
- **Vue.js:** v3.x
- **tailwindcss:** v3.x
- **Node.js:** v14.x
- **npm:** v6.x
- **Express:** v4.x 

## Project setup

You need to have Node.js installed on your machine.  You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Change into both directories and run the following commands in each, in a different shell.  I'm sure you have seen this before. Admitedly it is sub-optimal, finding the best solution is harder than I would have guessed and it's on the to-do list.

```

 `npm install`

```

```

`npm run dev`

```
### Notes
- The front end is served on port 3000
- The back end is served on port 5000
- The CSS is a mix of custom and tailwind, getting rid of Tailwind is on the to-do list


## To Do:
- [X] ~~Update the user components to script setup~~
- [X] ~~Update the user components to use the new composition API~~
- [ ] Create bash script to run both servers at once
- [X] ~~Create end point for suggest end point instead of the form keep cop out :)~~
- [ ] Publish results of link tests from different providers
- [~] ~~Create Admin Panel -- Manual add news for added.~~  Still need to manage batches.
- [ ] Move all css to custom away from tailwind
